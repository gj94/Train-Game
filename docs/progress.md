# Progress

## 2026-09-28 — Track sound from the user's Railway Sound Lab
- Source: `E:\ClaudeWS\railway-clang-simulator` (user's own Node.js lab; README explains both engines).
- **Cab:** `game/calibrated_bed.gd` = GDScript port of `src/calibrated.js` (stereo WSOLA of the approved
  5 s synthetic take, rhythm ∝ speed/55, pitch constant). Runs at 22.05 kHz, ~6% of one core.
- **Outside:** `game/rail_sounds.gd` = `src/synth.js` impact model with the 24 measured modes + 68 Hz body mode,
  randomized contact pressure, flam 4–7 ms later, contact noise; pre-rendered (4 variants × 2 bogies, ~1 s at
  startup) and fired per axle per rail joint with synth.js's speed gain and per-joint irregularity.
  synth.js's rolling bed (noise + sleeper pulse) is synthesized live.
- Cab ⇄ outside crossfade on Tab; "Train" bus reverb (+ cab low-pass). Eurostar loop no longer used.
- `tools/audio/render_clack_demo.gd` renders the outside clacks to a WAV for auditioning.
- Calibrated WAV must import uncompressed (`compress/mode=0`), a test checks it. 34 tests pass.

### Playtest (sound v3)
1. Cab (Tab): does it sound like your lab's calibrated simulator at the same speed? (55 km/h = the approved take)
2. Overview: clack rhythm and metal tone vs your lab's studio model.
3. Balance between track sound, motor whine, hum — any layer too loud/quiet?

## 2026-09-27 — Train sound
- `game/train_audio.gd`, attached over the leading bogie (3D, so quieter from the overview camera):
  - rolling: CC0 BigSoundBank interior loop, volume + pitch follow speed;
  - synthesized live: 3-phase traction whine (pitch ∝ speed, loudness ∝ power/brake handle), low-speed PWM
    whistle, transformer hum, flange squeal on curves (from `RailWorld.curvature_at`), air-brake hiss;
  - rail-joint clacks timed from `Train.odometer` as each nearby axle crosses a joint (13 m rails);
  - horn on **H**.
- 7 CC0 sounds downloaded (horns, pass-by, station, door beeps, 2 interiors); 3 not yet used.
- Test runner fix: failures (String results) used to crash the runner in Godot 4.7.

### Playtest (sound)
1. Pull away with W: does the whine rise with speed and fade when you coast (X)? Clacks speed up?
2. Brake (S) — hiss; emergency (Space) — big air dump. Horn (H).
3. Tight curves at speed (Maruthur loop, Chennapuram platform 2): squeal?
4. Tell me what's too loud / too quiet / annoying — levels are easy to tune in `train_audio.gd`.

### Planned: WAP-7 express as a second train
- Model: Sketchfab "WAP 7 Indian Locomotive Low Poly model" (knitro_vedant, CC BY) or its "New Design" version —
  the user downloads it (Sketchfab needs a login; glTF format into `assets/`). Credit the author in docs/assets.md.
- Coaches: build LHB coaches in Blender (tools/blender/) in the MEMU's style.
- Indian loco horn: Freesound pack "Indian Railway" by sama66 (login needed; user downloads).
- Game is offline personal use only (see memory) — personal-use / CC BY assets are fine.

## 2026-09-27 — Graphics upgrade (semi-realistic)
- CC0 Poly Haven PBR textures + clear-sky HDRI, Quaternius palm (see `docs/assets.md`).
- Lighting: HDRI ambient, AgX, SSAO, SSIL, glow, aerial fog, 4-split soft shadows, 8K shadow map, FXAA + MSAA.
- World: terrain mesh with hills; grass/laterite ground shader; soil shoulders; textured ballast, steel rails,
  concrete sleepers; 25 kV OHE masts + wires; Mangalore-tile roofs; paddy fields with bunds; palm clumps.
- Train: new MEMU model from `tools/blender/build_memu.py` (background Blender → `assets/models/memu.glb`):
  cab/trailer/motor cars, livery, windows, doors, bogies, pantographs, head/tail lamps; simple cab interior.

### Playtest (graphics)
1. Overview and cab: does it look "modern" enough? Anything that looks wrong or cheap?
2. Cab view: is the windscreen framing / eye height comfortable? (right-drag to look around)
3. Frame rate — is it smooth on your machine? (RTX 4090 laptop; if not, SSIL/shadows are the first to cut)
4. Ideas still open: grass tufts near the track, station details (people, lights, signage), textured train livery.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 1 first playable
**Sim (`sim/`, 26 headless tests):**
- `TrackGraph`: nodes / polyline edges / 3-way switches; facing + trailing moves; "trailing against" detection.
- `Train`: EMU-style combined power/brake handle, traction/power limits, running resistance, emergency brake,
  path tracking (head + occupied edges), change ends at a stand.
- `RailWorld`: 3-aspect signals protecting blocks up to the next signal; route locking with sectional release
  (switches locked, conflicting/opposing routes refused); signals return to red behind a train; SPAD detection
  with optional train protection (emergency brake); run-through of a trailing switch set against (warning);
  buffer-stop hit warning.
- Layout `first_line.gd`: Chennapuram (2-platform terminus) — 1.5 km — Maruthur (passing loop) — 1.3 km —
  Kadalur (terminus). 8-car MEMU (~175 m). 11 signals, 3 switches.

**Game (`game/`, main scene `game/main.tscn`):** procedural low-poly world (ballast/rails/sleepers, palms, paddy
fields, hills, stations with yellow name boards), MEMU model, signals with lit lamps, clickable signals/switches,
overview camera + cab camera with a smooth blend, HUD (speed, limit, handle, next signal + aspect, events).

**Known limits:** no train-to-train collision (only one train yet); no look-ahead for speed limits; overspeed only
warns; signal labels overlap near Chennapuram junction; route edges ahead that a train never reaches stay locked
(e.g. if it reverses before using the whole route) — put the signal back doesn't free them yet.

### Playtest checklist (run from the editor with F5, or the Run button)
1. Start: overview of Chennapuram. Press **C** (clear CPM-S1), hold **W** to ~50%, depart. Does acceleration feel right?
2. Press **Tab** to jump into the cab and back. Is the fly-in smooth? Is the cab view usable?
3. On the way, MRT-HE is red. Try stopping before it with **S** (brake). Then press **C** to clear it.
4. Before that: in overview (Tab), click switch **MRT_1** to route into the loop (marker turns orange, shows R).
   Try throwing a switch that's under a cleared route — it should refuse with a message.
5. Pass a red signal on purpose: protection should stop you (SPAD message). **Space** releases once stopped. **P** turns protection off.
6. Run into Kadalur, stop at the buffers, press **R** to change ends, drive back.
7. **T** speeds up time (×2/×4). **1/2/3** jump the camera to stations. **F** follows the train again.
8. Report: anything that feels wrong (controls, speeds, braking, camera), visual glitches, confusing HUD text.

## 2026-09-27 — PC setup
- Installed Node 24 LTS, Claude Code CLI 2.1.268, Godot 4.7.2, Blender 5.2.1, GitHub CLI.
- Engine decided: **Godot 4.x**. Godot MCP bridge + Blender connector both verified live.

## Decisions (brief §7)
Godot · South India, present-day Indian Railways (era assumed) · simple 3-aspect colour-light ·
middle-ground tone · both 2D schematic + 3D overview · small fictional first layout.

## Next
- Playtest feedback on the first playable → fixes.
- Phase 1 leftovers: speed-limit look-ahead / boards, horn + basic sounds, tidy label overlap.
- Phase 2 start: second (AI) train with collision safety, then the 2D schematic dispatcher panel.
