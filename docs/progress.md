# Progress

## 2026-09-27 — Phase 1 first playable
**Sim (`sim/`, 26 headless tests):**
- `TrackGraph`: nodes / polyline edges / 3-way switches; facing + trailing moves; "trailing against" detection.
- `Train`: EMU-style combined power/brake handle, traction/power limits, running resistance, emergency brake,
  path tracking (head + occupied edges), change ends at a stand.
- `RailWorld`: 3-aspect signals protecting blocks up to the next signal; route locking with sectional release
  (switches locked, conflicting/opposing routes refused); signals return to red behind a train; SPAD detection
  with optional train protection (emergency brake); run-through of a trailing switch set against (warning);
  buffer-stop hit warning.
- Layout `first_line.gd`: Chennapuram (2-platform terminus) — 1.5 km — Maruthur (passing loop) — 1.3 km —
  Kadalur (terminus). 8-car MEMU (~175 m). 11 signals, 3 switches.

**Game (`game/`, main scene `game/main.tscn`):** procedural low-poly world (ballast/rails/sleepers, palms, paddy
fields, hills, stations with yellow name boards), MEMU model, signals with lit lamps, clickable signals/switches,
overview camera + cab camera with a smooth blend, HUD (speed, limit, handle, next signal + aspect, events).

**Known limits:** no train-to-train collision (only one train yet); no look-ahead for speed limits; overspeed only
warns; signal labels overlap near Chennapuram junction; route edges ahead that a train never reaches stay locked
(e.g. if it reverses before using the whole route) — put the signal back doesn't free them yet.

### Playtest checklist (run from the editor with F5, or the Run button)
1. Start: overview of Chennapuram. Press **C** (clear CPM-S1), hold **W** to ~50%, depart. Does acceleration feel right?
2. Press **Tab** to jump into the cab and back. Is the fly-in smooth? Is the cab view usable?
3. On the way, MRT-HE is red. Try stopping before it with **S** (brake). Then press **C** to clear it.
4. Before that: in overview (Tab), click switch **MRT_1** to route into the loop (marker turns orange, shows R).
   Try throwing a switch that's under a cleared route — it should refuse with a message.
5. Pass a red signal on purpose: protection should stop you (SPAD message). **Space** releases once stopped. **P** turns protection off.
6. Run into Kadalur, stop at the buffers, press **R** to change ends, drive back.
7. **T** speeds up time (×2/×4). **1/2/3** jump the camera to stations. **F** follows the train again.
8. Report: anything that feels wrong (controls, speeds, braking, camera), visual glitches, confusing HUD text.

## 2026-09-27 — PC setup
- Installed Node 24 LTS, Claude Code CLI 2.1.268, Godot 4.7.2, Blender 5.2.1, GitHub CLI.
- Engine decided: **Godot 4.x**. Godot MCP bridge + Blender connector both verified live.

## Decisions (brief §7)
Godot · South India, present-day Indian Railways (era assumed) · simple 3-aspect colour-light ·
middle-ground tone · both 2D schematic + 3D overview · small fictional first layout.

## Next
- Playtest feedback on the first playable → fixes.
- Phase 1 leftovers: speed-limit look-ahead / boards, horn + basic sounds, tidy label overlap.
- Phase 2 start: second (AI) train with collision safety, then the 2D schematic dispatcher panel.
